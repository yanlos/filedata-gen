# format name has to contain "generate_file" and then something at the ends to differentiate it
# settings parameters:
# dedup_same_size:     "true" or "false"
#                      keep the random file sizes the same (using the same seed) so when you have more than one
#                      directories it will be easier to compare the deduplication. example: A and B have 5 files each,
#                      if true those 5 random files will be the same size, if false they will be different sizes

# create_database:     "false" or "MSExchange"
#                      false creates a normal file, unless a database is specified
#                      supports MSExchange as of now and more coming

# file generation parameters:
# directory:        directory for folder to be created
# size:             format with number space and size (B is exact # of bytes). ex: 512 B, 1 KB, 22 MB, 42 GB, 1 TB
# number_files:     number of randomly sized files
# compression_rate: percent that is not random characters (is white space)
# type_data:        can generate OS random bytes or ASCII characters: "bytes" or "ascii"
# folder_depth:     layers of folders in the directory before getting to data files
